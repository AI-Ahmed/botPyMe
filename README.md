Chatbots are nothing but an intelligent piece of software that can interact and communicate with people just like humans. Interesting, isnâ€™t it? So now let's see how they actually work.

- NLU (Natural Language Understanding): The ability of machines to understand human language like English.

- NLG (Natural Language Generation): The ability of a machine to generate text similar to human written sentences.
